# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my portfolio site's source code. Feel free to use it for your own projects. I should clarify, though, this is not designed to be easy to replace content for, I'm still working on that. So if you do use it for your project, make sure you edit the content appropriately.

That being said, feel free to contribute to the project by making a pull request. If you find any issues, please open an issue.
